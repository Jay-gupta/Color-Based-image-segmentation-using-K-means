 Projects  Edit project Integrated Hospital Management System Project nameIntegrated Hospital Management System May 2018 – Jul 2018  Project descriptionAim of project was to create a system to integrate all the hospitals under Indian Railway. The project included work on frontend, backend and database using AngularJS, NodeJS (Loopback), and MySQL Edit project Real time Face Recognition System using Support Vector Machine Project nameReal time Face Recognition System using Support Vector Machine Jun 2018 – Jul 2018  Project descriptionThe system uses OpenCV (Haar Cascade) to detect the face of an individual and using machine learning methods such as support vector classifier along with feature extraction algorithm (HOG) to recognize a person’s face. REQ: Python3.5, OpenCV, SVM, HOG descriptor  Edit project Color Based image segmentation using K-means Project nameColor Based image segmentation using K-means May 2018 – Jun 2018  Project descriptionThe purpose of the project is to decompose an image into meaningful partitions using Feature-space methods, such as clustering. Kmeans intends to classify pixels to different groups in a pre-defined color space and then manipulating the pixels to apply changes to the image.
